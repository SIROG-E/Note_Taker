  ## Description
 Note Taker is an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application uses an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

For this homework we were given the application frontend. It was my job to build the backend and connect the two.

## Usage
The user will be able to:
- Write and save notes.
- Preview and/or Edit saved notes. 
- Delete previous saved notes.
- Create as many notes as the user needs.

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.
